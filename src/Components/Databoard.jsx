    <p className="m-3 p-1 ">FOXEROXX is a web-based tool designed specifically for student groups who regularly share expenses for document printing or "xeroxing" in college environments. In many hostels or classrooms, one person typically takes on the responsibility of collecting documents, printing them, and then collecting payments later ‚Äî often leading to confusion, forgetfulness, or unbalanced dues.
FOXEROXX eliminates this hassle by allowing students to:
Create and manage custom groups.
Track each xerox task along with its cost.
Log who paid and how much.
Automatically calculate outstanding balances for each group member.
It stores all data securely in the browser using localStorage, so there's no need for a backend or login system ‚Äî just open the app and start managing your xerox tasks more efficiently.
This tool helps maintain clarity, transparency, and accountability within student groups, making it a practical solution for day-to-day academic collaboration.</p>
